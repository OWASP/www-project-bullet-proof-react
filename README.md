# Bullet-Proof React

## Description

Bullet-Proof React is an exhaustive resource aimed at fortifying React and Node.js applications against potential threats. It serves as a one-stop guide for developers, security professionals, and organizations to understand, identify, and mitigate vulnerabilities in their React and Node.js applications. This project is under the OWASP banner, dedicated to enhancing the security of web applications.

## Project Deliverables

1. Comprehensive documentation detailing vulnerabilities in React and Node.js applications.
2. Demonstrative applications showcasing each vulnerability and its defense mechanism.
3. Best practices guide for secure coding in React and Node.js.
4. Step-by-step guides for implementing various authentication methods.
5. Detailed guidelines on setting up Content Security Policies (CSPs) and other security configurations for React and Node.js applications.
